# blogs
<h3>Java Framework for business-operations logging</h3>
<br>
This Framework based on standard <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/logging/overview.html">JUL Framework</a>
The main difference between JUL and blogs is a way of transmissing records from Logger instance to Handler object. 
There are also no Filter objects and relationships to parent Logger instances.
